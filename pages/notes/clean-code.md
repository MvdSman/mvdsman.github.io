# Clean Code

While reading _Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship_ by Robert C. Martin, A.K.A. "Uncle Bob", a lot of points made were very relatable. I decided to create these notes to keep a summary of the - for me - most important things to keep in mind.

## Why clean code

Why would you want code to be clean? For me, it's mostly because:

- Code should be efficient
- Code can be read and enhanced by other people than the author
- Code has a goal which should be clear by reading it

## How to keep code clean

> The following will only be a subset of the entire "ruleset" described in the book. For a full list, see [the table](./clean-code-smells-and-heuristics.md) (the numbering and names match both below and the book).

### Meaningful Names

- N1: Choose Desriptive Names
