  title: "About me"
  url: '/about/'
  text: 'I am a M.Sc. Computer Science - Bioinformatics student at the University of Leiden and the Technical University of Delft in the Netherlands. My B.Sc. was Biology, so most of my initial experience with programming and visualisation was done in my spare time out of interest. Throughout my education, I became aware that bioinformatics was the way to go for me, as I became more and more motivated to visualise and analyse everything that we found during our experiments in the lab and the field.'
