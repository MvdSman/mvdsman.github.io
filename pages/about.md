Because I love to do these things, it's easy for me to put a lot of effort in a project and try and get the most out of it. I'm a keen learner and have at least a basic level of experience in multiple languages.


## Skillset

Especially during the last few years, I tried to develop my skillset doing internships, following some internet courses, doing private projects and of course by chosing the right courses during my Bachelor's degree. I started focusing on R, but it does not limit me to other languages: I like being versatile.
The most noteworthy languages I'm experienced in are:
- R
- Python (in progress)
- C++
- HTML
- CSS
- Markdown

I also know the basics of PHP and MySQL.

Besides the languages used, it is of course also important to know what to do with the data itself. I have had multiple courses in statistics/statistical analysis and have a basic understanding/experience in several methods from Data Mining, Artificial Intelligence (including neural networks) and Business Intelligence & Process Modelling.
Data visualisation is where my heart lies, so I hope to get involved in that particular specialisation.

## I got inspired by...

Most of the times I got inspired by researchers talking about their own research. I noticed a huge difference in the way biologists and bio-informaticians try to communicate their findings: especially the visualisations were noticibly different. I started asking myself how I would approach these tasks myself and became more and more intrigued by the possibilities in the analysis and visualisation of the data. Together with my old interests in informatics, it was a no-brainer for me to start preparing for a switch to bioinformatics. The minor Data Science brought me in touch with different methods to handle and analyse data, which made my choice for a M.Sc. in Bioinformatics definite.
