Because I love to do these things, it's easy for me to put a lot of effort in a project and try and get the most out of it. I'm a keen learner and have at least a basic level of experience in multiple [languages](#Skillset).


## Skillset

Especially during the last few years, I tried to develop my skillset doing internships, following some internet courses, doing private projects and of course by chosing the right courses during my Bachelor's degree. I started focusing on R, but it does not limit me to other languages: I like being versatile.
The most noteworthy languages I'm experienced in are:
- R
- C++
- HTML
- CSS

I also know the basics of Python, PHP and MySQL.
